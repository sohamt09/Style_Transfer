# Style_Transfer using Tensorflow

Style transfer is the technique of recomposing images in the style of other images. These were mostly created using Justin Johnson's code based on the paper by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge demonstrating a method for restyling images using convolutional neural networks.
Here it has been implemented using Tensorflow
